				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>
					Hello guys, I'm Michael. I'm in my first year at Tokyo International University and majoring in Digital Business and Innovation. I'm Interested in Creative Industry, Investing, and Digital Business. I am always passionate and push myself to learn new things, also driven to advance the skills I had now to contribute to others.

				<h3><br>It started when I was Junior High</br></h3>
				<p>
					It was started when I got my first camera from my parents. It was Canon Eos M-3. I was really happy at that time, so I learned the basics of photography and vidography. At that time, I just joined a documentary staff in my highschool, but since I came to Japan, I became a hobbyist photographer and working together with <a href="https://www.thespherestudio.com/">Sphere Studio</a>.

				<h3><br>My Portfolio Website</br></h3>
				<p>
					Actually, I have made my own portfolio website using Wordpress. I made it because of the IT Literacy task that requires it. Click the button below to see it!
